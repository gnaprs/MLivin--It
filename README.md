# MLivin' It
## Welcome to MLivin' It. The app engineering productive health, anytime, anywhere.

### Dataset
Here, you'll find the implementation of our DCNN Resnet-18 model used to perform image classification of pictures taken from your very own phone gallery. In this implementation, we tackle a small-scale multiclass classification problem with 5 different foods:
- nasi lemak
- omu rice
- fried chicken
- chicken porridge
- chicken rice

We employ a transfer learning approach to tackle the challenge of starting with a small input dataset, and achieve a very decent 93% accuracy with our vaildation set! 

### App Development
Our app is built in Adobe XD, and optimized to run on an iPhone X. However, the program allows for versitility in porting to other OSes such as Android, or even web-based applications.
