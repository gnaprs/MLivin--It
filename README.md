# MLivin' It
## Welcome to MLivin' It. The app engineering productive health, anytime, anywhere.

Here, you'll find the implementation of our DCNN Resnet-18 model used to perform image classification of pictures taken from your very own phone gallery. In this implementation, we tackle a small-scale multiclass classification problem with 5 different foods:
- nasi lemak
- omu rice
- fried chicken
- chicken porridge
- chicken rice

We employ a transfer learning approach to tackle the challenge of starting with a small input dataset, and achieve a very decent 93% accuracy with our vaildation set!
